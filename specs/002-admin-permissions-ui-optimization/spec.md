# Feature Specification: 管理后台权限配置与界面优化

**Feature Branch**: `002-admin-permissions-ui-optimization`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "给管理后台配置一套权限操作，并且优化管理后台的界面以及用户体验"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: What specific security clearance levels are needed for the admin roles? → A: Custom role-based system with fine-grained permissions
- Q: What level of UI personalization should be supported for admin users? → A: Full personalization (custom widgets, dashboard layout, color schemes)
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent access to the same admin resource by multiple users? → A: First-come, first-served locking (first user gets exclusive access)
- Q: What performance expectations should the admin interface meet? → A: Standard performance (pages load within 1-2 seconds)
- Q: For the audit logging requirement, what level of detail is required? → A: Comprehensive logs (all standard data plus before/after values, IP, session info)
- Q: What specific data types should be searchable and filterable in the admin panel? → A: User accounts, roles, and permissions only
- Q: What navigation patterns should be implemented for the admin interface? → A: Sidebar navigation with collapsible menu items
- Q: What key metrics and system status information should be displayed on the admin dashboard? → A: Comprehensive set including all of the above
- Q: How should the system handle permission changes for users who are currently logged in? → A: Apply changes immediately, potentially restricting access mid-session
- Q: What level of accessibility should the admin interface support? → A: Basic level - support keyboard navigation and basic screen reader functionality

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
作为一个管理员用户，我希望能够通过权限控制系统来分配不同级别的访问权限给不同的管理员账户，同时拥有一个优化的、直观的用户界面，以便我能高效地管理平台内容和用户，提升我的工作效率和使用体验。

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am an admin user with sufficient permissions, **When** I access the admin panel, **Then** I should see options that are appropriate to my assigned role and permissions.
2. **Given** I am an admin user trying to access restricted functionality, **When** I attempt to navigate to that area, **Then** I should be blocked from accessing it based on my role permissions.
3. **Given** I need to add a new admin user, **When** I fill in the required information and assign role permissions, **Then** the system should save the user with the specified permissions.
4. **Given** I am using the admin panel, **When** I navigate between different sections, **Then** I should experience an intuitive interface with clear navigation and visual feedback.
5. **Given** I am performing administrative tasks, **When** I make changes to user data or system settings, **Then** I should receive clear feedback about the success or failure of my actions.

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle admin users with different permission levels trying to access the same resource?
- When multiple admins try to access the same resource, the first user gets exclusive access with a locking mechanism
- When a user's permissions are changed while they are actively using the system, changes are applied immediately which may restrict their access mid-session

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement a custom role-based access control (RBAC) system with fine-grained permissions that defines different permission levels for admin users
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow administrators with appropriate permissions to assign roles and permissions to other admin accounts
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to only access features and data that their assigned role permits based on the fine-grained permission system
- **FR-004**: System MUST enforce permission checks at both the UI level and API level
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide comprehensive audit logging for all administrative actions, including user identity, timestamp, action performed, target resource, action outcome, IP address, session information, and before/after values for any modified data
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide an intuitive navigation system using sidebar navigation with collapsible menu items that allows admins to efficiently find and access required functionality
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide visual feedback for all admin actions (success, error, loading states)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support full personalization of the admin interface including custom widgets, dashboard layout, and color schemes as per user preferences
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide search and filtering capabilities for admin panel data views, specifically for user accounts, roles, and permissions
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide dashboard views with comprehensive key metrics and system status information including user activity metrics, system performance metrics, and business metrics

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Admin interface pages MUST load within 1-2 seconds to meet standard performance expectations
- **NFR-002**: Admin interface MUST support basic accessibility including keyboard navigation and screen reader functionality

### Key Entities
- **Admin User**: Represents an administrative account with specific permissions and role assignments
- **Role**: Defines a set of permissions that can be assigned to admin users
- **Permission**: Defines a specific capability or access level (e.g., read user data, modify settings, etc.)
- **Audit Log**: Records all administrative actions for security and compliance purposes
