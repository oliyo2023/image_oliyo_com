# Research: AI Image Generation and Editing Website

**Feature**: AI Image Generation and Editing Website  
**Date**: 2025-10-03  
**Spec**: E:\project\oliyo.com\specs\001-qwen-image-edit\spec.md

## Research Findings

### AI Model Integration

**Decision**: Use qwen-image-edit and gemini-flash-image models via API integration
**Rationale**:

- Both models support text-to-image generation and image editing capabilities
- qwen-image-edit: 5 credits per operation (more cost-effective)
- gemini-flash-image: 10 credits per operation (premium features)
- Models support image-to-image editing workflows
  **Alternatives considered**:
- OpenAI DALL-E: More expensive, limited editing capabilities
- Stable Diffusion: Self-hosted option but requires more infrastructure
- Midjourney: API limitations, less suitable for integration

### Authentication System

**Decision**: Email/password with optional social login (Google, Facebook)
**Rationale**:

- Email/password provides core authentication functionality
- Social login reduces friction for user onboarding
- JWT-based session management for scalability
- bcryptjs for password hashing (already in dependencies)
  **Alternatives considered**:
- Magic links: Less secure, requires email service integration
- OAuth-only: Would exclude users without social accounts

### Credit System

**Decision**: Credit-based consumption with Stripe integration
**Rationale**:

- Clear cost structure: 5 credits for qwen, 10 for gemini
- 100 free credits on registration to encourage trial
- Stripe integration for payment processing (already in dependencies)
- Credit transactions logged for audit purposes
  **Alternatives considered**:
- Subscription model: Less flexible for casual users
- Pay-per-use: More complex billing integration

### Image Storage

**Decision**: AWS S3 with R2 integration
**Rationale**:

- Scalable storage for user-uploaded and generated images
- 50MB file size limit as specified in requirements
- Support for common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, etc.)
- Existing R2 integration in codebase
  **Alternatives considered**:
- Local filesystem: Not scalable for production
- Cloudinary: Additional cost, overkill for current needs

### Database Design

**Decision**: Prisma ORM with SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (production)
**Rationale**:

- Prisma already integrated in project
- Type-safe database access with TypeScript
- SQLite for development simplicity
- PostgreSQL for production scalability
- Existing schema includes user, credit, and image models
  **Alternatives considered**:
- MongoDB: Less structured, not needed for current requirements
- Supabase: Additional abstraction layer, not necessary

### Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Async processing with task queue
**Rationale**:

- AI model operations can be slow (60-second target)
- Task queue prevents blocking user requests
- Resource locking for concurrent operations
- Redis for rate limiting and caching (already in dependencies)
  **Alternatives considered**:
- Synchronous processing: Would timeout for complex operations
- Serverless functions: Less control over execution environment

### Admin Interface

**Decision**: Integrated admin dashboard within Next.js app
**Rationale**:

- Single codebase for maintenance
- Role-based access control (already implemented)
- Real-time analytics and user management
- Article publishing system for content management
  **Alternatives considered**:
- Separate admin application: Additional complexity
- Third-party admin tools: Less integrated with business logic

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Comprehensive testing with Jest and Testing Library
**Rationale**:

- Unit tests for services and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Contract tests for AI model integrations
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Performance tests for scalability validation
  **Alternatives considered**:
- Minimal testing: Higher risk of production issues
- External testing services: Additional cost and complexity

### Security Considerations

**Decision**: Multi-layered security approach
**Rationale**:

- HTTPS for all communications
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Input validation and sanitization
- Content moderation with user confirmation
- Audit logging for all operations
  **Alternatives considered**:
- Basic security only: Insufficient for user data protection
- Over-engineered security: Unnecessary complexity for current scope

## Technical Requirements Resolved

### NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Database Choice

**Resolved**: Prisma with SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)

- Existing Prisma integration in project
- Type-safe database operations
- Easy migration between environments

### NEEDS CLARIFICATION: AI Model Integration Method

**Resolved**: API-based integration with request/response handling

- Models support REST API endpoints
- Async processing for long-running operations
- Error handling for failed requests

### NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Payment Processing

**Resolved**: Stripe integration (already in dependencies)

- Secure payment processing
- Credit purchase workflows
- Transaction logging

### NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Image Processing Pipeline

**Resolved**: Upload → Validate → Process → Store → Log

- Formidable for file uploads (already in dependencies)
- AWS S3/R2 for storage
- Database logging for audit trail

## Integration Patterns

### API Design

- RESTful endpoints for all operations
- Consistent error response format
- Request/response validation with Zod
- Rate limiting with Redis

### Frontend Architecture

- Next.js App Router for routing
- Server components for static content
- Client components for interactive features
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Backend Services

- Modular service architecture
- Dependency injection pattern
- Error boundaries and logging
- Health checks and monitoring

## Performance Considerations

### Response Time Targets

- API endpoints: <2 seconds for 95% of requests
- Image generation: <60 seconds for 95% of requests
- Web pages: Core Web Vitals compliant

### Scalability Requirements

- 100+ concurrent users
- Dynamic scaling based on demand
- Database connection pooling
- CDN for static assets

### Resource Management

- Credit-based usage control
- Request timeout handling
- Memory usage optimization
- File size limits enforced

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **AI Model Availability**: Mitigation with fallback models
- **Performance Degradation**: Mitigation with monitoring and scaling
- **Data Loss**: Mitigation with backups and audit logging
- **Security Breaches**: Mitigation with security best practices

### Business Risks

- **User Adoption**: Mitigation with free credits and intuitive UI
- **Cost Management**: Mitigation with credit system and monitoring
- **Content Moderation**: Mitigation with user confirmation system
- **Payment Processing**: Mitigation with reliable Stripe integration

## Conclusion

All technical requirements have been clarified through research. The proposed architecture leverages existing dependencies and follows best practices for AI-powered web applications. The implementation plan addresses all functional requirements while maintaining scalability, security, and performance targets.

**Next Steps**: Proceed to Phase 1 - Design & Contracts
