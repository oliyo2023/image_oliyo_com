# Research: AI Image Generation and Editing Website

## Overview
This research document explores the technical decisions required for implementing the AI Image Generation and Editing Website, including AI model integration, payment processing, image handling, and architectural decisions.

## Decision: AI Model Integration Approach
- **Decision**: Use a service layer abstraction to integrate with both qwen-image-edit and gemini-flash-image models
- **Rationale**: This approach allows for flexibility in switching between AI models, potential A/B testing, and handling different pricing structures as clarified in the specification (different costs for different AI models)
- **Alternatives Considered**: Direct API calls without abstraction layer (less maintainable), single model integration (violates requirements)

## Decision: Payment Processing Solution
- **Decision**: Implement Stripe for credit purchase functionality
- **Rationale**: Stripe offers robust APIs, strong security practices, multiple payment methods, and is widely used for digital product purchases. Well-documented with good developer support.
- **Alternatives Considered**: PayPal (slightly more complex for recurring digital purchases), Square (good but less focused on online payments), Custom payment solution (high security complexity)

## Decision: Image Storage Strategy
- **Decision**: Use AWS S3 with CDN (CloudFront) for image storage
- **Rationale**: S3 provides reliable, scalable object storage with good performance and security. CDN will ensure fast delivery of generated and uploaded images globally. Can handle the 50MB file size requirement.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Cloudinary (also good but more specialized and potentially more costly), Database storage (not efficient for large image files), Local storage (not scalable)

## Decision: Authentication System
- **Decision**: Use NextAuth.js for authentication with support for email/password and social login
- **Rationale**: NextAuth.js integrates well with Next.js, supports multiple providers for the social login requirement, has good security practices, and handles OAuth flows securely.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Auth0 (good but more costly), Firebase Auth (capable but potentially vendor lock-in), Custom JWT solution (more control but more security considerations)

## Decision: Database and ORM
- **Decision**: Use PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Rationale**: PostgreSQL is robust and feature-rich for the data relationships required in this application. Prisma provides type safety, good migration tools, and an intuitive query API. Both align well with TypeScript.
- **Alternatives Considered**: MongoDB (good for document data but less suitable for relational data like user accounts and credit transactions), MySQL (good but less modern than PostgreSQL), SQLite (good for prototyping but not for production scale)

## Decision: Caching Strategy
- **Decision**: Implement Redis for session storage and API response caching
- **Rationale**: Redis is fast and reliable for session storage, especially important for managing user authentication across multiple instances. Also useful for caching expensive operations like model usage statistics.
- **Alternatives Considered**: In-memory caching (not persistent across instances), Database caching (slower than Redis), No caching (could lead to performance issues during scale)

## Decision: Rate Limiting Implementation
- **Decision**: Use a combination of Next.js middleware and Redis for rate limiting
- **Rationale**: This allows for precise control over request rates, prevents API abuse, and stores rate limit counters across server instances.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Cloud provider rate limiting (less granular control), No rate limiting (would violate security requirements)

## Decision: Image Processing Pipeline
- **Decision**: Process images on the server-side with client-side previews
- **Rationale**: Server-side processing ensures consistency and security. Client-side previews provide better user experience. This handles the requirement where users can upload images for "image-to-image" editing.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Client-side only (limited by browser capabilities), Third-party processing service (potentially more expensive and less control)
