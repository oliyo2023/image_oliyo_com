# Research: AI Image Generation and Editing Website

## Overview
This research document outlines the key technical decisions and findings for implementing the AI image generation and editing website with credit-based system.

## Decision: AI Model Integration
**Rationale**: The feature specification requires integration with qwen-image-edit and gemini-flash-image models for image generation and editing capabilities.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Only one AI model (reduces flexibility)
- Other AI models like DALL-E, Midjourney (licensing/cost constraints)
- Open-source models (requires more infrastructure)

## Decision: Credit System Architecture
**Rationale**: To manage usage and costs, implementing a credit-based system where qwen-image-edit costs 5 credits and gemini-flash-image costs 10 credits.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Time-based usage limits (harder to manage variable processing times)
- Subscription model (less flexible for casual users)
- Ad-supported model (conflicts with user experience goals)

## Decision: Authentication System
**Rationale**: Using email/password authentication with optional social login (Google, Facebook) to provide security and user convenience.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Only social login (limits user options)
- Only email/password (reduces user convenience)
- OAuth2 with custom providers (increased complexity)

## Decision: Image Storage and Management
**Rationale**: Implementing secure storage for user-uploaded and generated images with support for common formats up to 50MB files, with HTTPS encryption.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Client-side encryption (increased complexity for users)
- Direct cloud storage links (security concerns)
- Temporary storage only (limits user functionality)

## Decision: Tech Stack
**Rationale**: Using Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Node.js 18+, and Vercel deployment to align with constitutional requirements and ensure performance, security, and maintainability.
**Alternatives considered**:
- React + separate backend (increased complexity)
- Other frameworks (deviate from constitutional requirements)
- Pure backend API (misses Next.js benefits like SSR/SSG)

## Decision: Database Solution
**Rationale**: Using PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM to handle user accounts, credit transactions, image metadata, and articles as required by constitutional guidelines.
**Alternatives considered**:
- MongoDB (less structured for transactional data)
- SQLite (insufficient for production scale)
- No database (impractical for user data management)

## Decision: Security Approach
**Rationale**: Implementing basic security with standard HTTPS, server-side validation, authentication/authorization as per constitutional requirements.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Advanced security measures (increased complexity without clear requirement)
- Client-side encryption (not necessary per feature spec)
- Additional authentication factors (not specified in requirements)

## Performance Considerations
**Rationale**: The system should meet 95% uptime targets with API responses under 2 seconds and image generation within 60 seconds for 95% of requests.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Higher performance targets (more expensive infrastructure)
- Lower targets (degraded user experience)
- Asynchronous processing (required anyway for AI model operations)
