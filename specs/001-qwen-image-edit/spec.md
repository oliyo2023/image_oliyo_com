# Feature Specification: AI Image Generation and Editing Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-qwen-image-edit`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "我要做一个利用大模型(qwen-image-edit,gemini-flash-image)来根据提示词生成图片和编辑图片的网站，支持用户登录，用户使用提示词来生成和修改图片时，需要消耗一定额度的积分，在用户注册时，可以赠送100额度的积分，同时用户可以上传自己的图片，因为这些模型支持以图改图的模式的，同时，当用户积分不够时，可以购买积分，我还需要一个后台管理，来管理这些用户，了解充值情况，以及各个模型的消耗情况，同时后台也可以发布一些文章案例等到网站上"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30

- Q: How many credits should be consumed for each type of operation on the platform? → A: Different costs for different AI models (qwen vs gemini)
- Q: For user authentication, which method should be implemented for the platform? → A: Email/password with optional social login (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Q: What performance expectations should the image generation and editing operations meet? → A: Performance not critical - users expect delays for AI processing
- Q: What image file types and maximum file sizes should be supported for user uploads? → A: Any common image format with max 50MB files
- Q: How many concurrent users should the system be designed to support? → A: Scale dynamically based on demand

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user visits the website, registers for an account, receives 100 free credits upon registration, and uses these credits to generate images from text prompts or edit existing images using AI models (qwen-image-edit, gemini-flash-image). When credits run low, the user can purchase more credits. The user can also upload their own images for editing. Meanwhile, an admin user manages the platform through a backend system, monitoring user accounts, credit consumption, and publishing articles and examples.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new visitor to the website, **When** they register for an account, **Then** they should receive 100 credits and be able to use them to generate or edit images
2. **Given** a registered user with sufficient credits, **When** they enter a text prompt to generate an image, **Then** the system should use an AI model to generate an image and deduct the appropriate number of credits based on the selected AI model
3. **Given** a registered user with sufficient credits, **When** they upload an image and provide a text prompt to edit it, **Then** the system should use an AI model to modify the image and deduct the appropriate number of credits based on the selected AI model
4. **Given** a user with insufficient credits, **When** they attempt to generate or edit an image, **Then** they should be prompted to purchase more credits
5. **Given** an admin user logged into the backend system, **When** they view user management, **Then** they should be able to see all registered users and their credit balances
6. **Given** an admin user logged into the backend system, **When** they view model usage, **Then** they should be able to see consumption statistics for each AI model
7. **Given** an admin user logged into the backend system, **When** they create a new article or example, **Then** it should be published on the website for users to view

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an AI model request fails during image generation/editing?
- How does the system handle concurrent requests from the same user?
- What happens when a user uploads an unsupported image file type? [RESOLVED: Any common image format supported]
- How does the system handle extremely long text prompts?
- What is the maximum file size for uploaded images? [RESOLVED: Max 50MB files]
- How does the system handle users attempting to exploit the credit system?

### Performance Requirements
- Image generation requests must complete within 60 seconds for 95% of requests
- Web pages must meet Core Web Vitals thresholds: 90 LCP, 90 FID, 90 CLS
- API endpoints must respond within 2 seconds for 95% of requests under normal load
- System must support concurrent usage by 100+ users without performance degradation
